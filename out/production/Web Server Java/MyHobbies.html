&emsp;I play D&D at least for four hours a week.
	I then outside of that will plan out my sessions for my players with a lot of prep work. <br>
&emsp;<br>
&emsp;I either host my sessions online through discord or in person at my apartment.

Recently, I purchased Elden Ring created by From Software.
This game falls into the Souls-Like genre. <br><br>
The game is focused on fighting massive monsters with extremely hard movesets.
	The game puts you into world where it seems helpless but you have the power to defeat these monsters.
